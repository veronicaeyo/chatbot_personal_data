Give us feedback → (opens in a new tab)Edit this pagePrompt EngineeringPrompt Engineering Guide\\nPrompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).\\nResearchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.\\nPrompt engineering is not just about designing and developing prompts. It encompasses a wide range of skills and techniques that are useful for interacting and developing with LLMs. It's an important skill to interface, build with, and understand capabilities of LLMs. You can use prompt engineering to improve safety of LLMs and build new capabilities like augmenting LLMs with domain knowledge and external tools.\\nMotivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, we have created this new prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, learning guides, models, lectures, references, new LLM capabilities, and tools related to prompt engineering.\\n\\nDue to high demand, we've partnered with Maven to deliver a new cohort-based course on Prompt Engineering for LLMs (opens in a new tab).\\nElvis Saravia (opens in a new tab), who has worked at companies like Meta AI and Elastic, and has years of experience in AI and LLMs, will be the instructor for this course.\\nThis hands-on course will cover prompt engineering techniques/tools, use cases, exercises, and projects for effectively working and building with large language models (LLMs).\\nOur past learners range from software engineers to AI researchers and practitioners in organizations like LinkedIn, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Intuit, Fidelity Investments, Coinbase, Guru, and many others.IntroductionEnglishlightCopyright © 2023 DAIR.AI\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.promptingguide.ai/', 'title': 'Prompt Engineering Guide | Prompt Engineering Guide ', 'language': 'en'})]"

      "When working with prompts, you interact with the LLM via an API or directly. You can configure a few parameters to get different results for your prompts.\n",
      "Temperature - In short, the lower the temperature, the more deterministic the results in the sense that the highest probable next token is always picked. Increasing temperature could lead to more randomness, which encourages more diverse or creative outputs. You are essentially increasing the weights of the other possible tokens. In terms of application, you might want to use a lower temperature value for tasks like fact-based QA to encourage more factual and concise responses. For poem generation or other creative tasks, it might be beneficial to increase the temperature value.\n",
      "Top_p - Similarly, with top_p, a sampling technique with temperature called nucleus sampling, you can control how deterministic the model is at generating a response. If you are looking for exact and factual answers keep this low. If you are looking for more diverse responses, increase to a higher value.\n",
      "The general recommendation is to alter one, not both.\n",
      "Before starting with some basic examples, keep in mind that your results may vary depending on the version of LLM you use.IntroductionBasics of PromptingEnglishlightCopyright © 2023 DAIR.AI\n"
